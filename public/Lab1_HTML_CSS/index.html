        <em class="universalstyle">The Rubik's Cube is a 3-D combination puzzle</em> invented in 1974 by Hungarian
        sculptor and professor

        Originally called the Magic Cube, the puzzle was licensed by Rubik to be sold by Pentangle Puzzles in the UK in
        1978, and then by Ideal Toy Corp in 1980 via businessman Tibor Laczi and Seven Towns founder Tom Kremer. The
        cube was released internationally in 1980 and became one of the most recognized icons in popular culture.<br />

        In March 1970,
        <a class="highlightlink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_D._Nichols" title="larrydnichols"
          >Larry D. Nichols</a
        ><!-- a masodik link tipust hasznaltam itt -->
        invented a 2×2×2 "Puzzle with Pieces Rotatable in Groups" and filed a Canadian patent application for it.
        Nichols's cube was held together by magnets. Nichols was granted U.S. patent 3,655,201 on 11 April 1972, two
        years before Rubik invented his Cube. On 9 April 1970, Frank Fox applied to patent an "amusement device", a type
        of sliding puzzle on a spherical surface with "at least two 3×3 arrays" intended to be used for the game of
        noughts and crosses. He received his UK patent (1344259) on 16 January 1974.

          After the first batches of Rubik's Cubes were released in May 1980, initial sales were modest, but Ideal began
          a television advertising campaign in the middle of the year which it supplemented with newspaper
          advertisements. At the end of 1980, Rubik's Cube won a German Game of the Year special award and won similar
          awards for best toy in the UK, France, and the US. By 1981, Rubik's Cube had become a craze, and it is
          estimated that in the period from 1980 to 1983 around 200 million Rubik's Cubes were sold worldwide. In March
          1981, a speedcubing championship organised by the Guinness Book of World Records was held in Munich, and a
          Rubik's Cube was depicted on the front cover of Scientific American that same month. In June 1981, The
          Washington Post reported that Rubik's Cube is "a puzzle that's moving like fast food right now ... this year's
          Hoola Hoop or Bongo Board", and by September 1981, New Scientist noted that the cube had "captivated the
          attention of children of ages from 7 to 70 all over the world this summer." As most people could solve only
          one or two sides, numerous books were published including David Singmaster's Notes on Rubik's "Magic Cube"
          (1980) and Patrick Bossert's You Can Do the Cube (1981). At one stage in 1981, three of the top ten best
          selling books in the US were books on solving Rubik's Cube, and the best-selling book of 1981 was James G.
          Nourse's The Simple Solution to Rubik's Cube which sold over 6 million copies. In 1981, the Museum of Modern
          Art in New York exhibited a Rubik's Cube, and at the 1982 World's Fair in Knoxville, Tennessee a six-foot Cube
          was put on display. ABC Television even developed a cartoon show called Rubik, the Amazing Cube. In June 1982,
          the First Rubik's Cube World Championship took place in Budapest and would become the only competition
          recognized as official until the championship was revived in 2003. In October 1982, The New York Times
          reported that sales had fallen and that "the craze has died", and by 1983 it was clear that sales had
          plummeted. However, in some countries such as China and the USSR, the craze had started later and demand was
          still high because of a shortage of Cubes.
